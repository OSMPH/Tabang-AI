# HRSL Philippine

This data is a GeoJSON derived from Facebook's [High Resolution Settlement Layer](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/mapping-the-world-to-help-aid-workers-with-weakly-semi-supervised-learning/) for the Philippines.

Using QGIS, the HRSL raster layer was was converted to vector.  Using the QGIS processing tool, we created a buffer of 100 meter for each polygon and then intersected with HDX's [Philippine administrative data](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/philippines-administrative-levels-0-to-3).
